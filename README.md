# Fast React Pizza Co.

This project is a **responsive React web application** for a fictional pizza restaurant, "Fast React Pizza Co." It showcases the restaurant's menu, availability of items, and current open/closed status based on the system's time. Users can browse the menu, and if the restaurant is open, they can also place an order through the UI.

## Features

- **Menu Rendering**: Displays a dynamic list of pizzas from a data file, with visual indicators for sold-out items.
- **Store Hours Check**: The footer automatically reflects whether the restaurant is open or closed based on the system time.
- **Conditional Rendering**: If the store is open, an order button is visible. If closed, a message is displayed with the opening hours.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout adapts across different screen sizes using CSS Grid and Flexbox.
- **Interactive UI**: The app provides a button for placing an order when the restaurant is open, enhancing user experience.

---

## Technologies

- **React.js**: The core library used to build the UI components.
- **CSS3**: Styling is done using custom styles and Google Fonts to maintain a consistent and visually appealing layout.
- **JavaScript ES6+**: Features like array methods (`map`) and destructuring are used for cleaner, modern code.

## Components Overview

The app is built using several reusable components:

1. **App**: The root component that contains the structure of the page, including the header, menu, and footer.
   
2. **Header**: Displays the title of the app using a simple `h1` tag. Inline CSS is used for customization.
   
3. **Menu**: Responsible for rendering the list of pizzas. If no pizzas are available, it shows a placeholder message. It maps over `pizzaData` to generate individual pizza components.

4. **Pizza**: Each pizza is rendered as a list item, displaying the name, ingredients, price, and a "sold out" status if applicable.

5. **Footer**: Displays a message about whether the restaurant is open or closed. This is determined based on the current time compared to predefined opening and closing hours.

6. **Order**: This component shows up in the footer if the restaurant is open, prompting the user to place an order.

## Styling

- The app's styles are written in pure CSS, with a minimal and clean design approach.
- Responsive layout is achieved using a combination of CSS Grid (for the pizzas) and Flexbox (for centering and spacing content).
- Font is provided by [Google Fonts (Roboto Mono)](https://fonts.google.com/), giving the app a modern, tech-savvy feel.
- A color palette with warm, inviting tones (yellows and greys) complements the restaurant theme.

## Future Enhancements

1. **Backend Integration**: Connect the app with a backend API for storing real pizza data and handling orders.
2. **State Management**: Incorporate a global state management solution like Redux or React Context for more complex state handling as the app grows.
3. **Animations**: Add subtle animations for menu transitions and order interactions to enhance user experience.
4. **Order Cart**: Introduce a shopping cart functionality for users to place multiple orders at once.
